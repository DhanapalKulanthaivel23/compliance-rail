# Compliance Rail — Go REST API example

A standalone API example using synthetic records and in-memory storage.

- Create, list, read, update and delete records.
- Validate JSON input.
- Run HTTP handler tests.
- Build a small container image.

## Structure

```text
base/
controller/
libs/
main.go
Dockerfile
```

## Run and test

```sh
go test -race ./...
go run .
```

The API listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Set `LISTEN_ADDR` to override it. Data resets when the process stops.

## API

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| GET | /health |
| POST | /records |
| GET | /records |
| GET | /records/{id} |
| PUT | /records/{id} |
| DELETE | /records/{id} |

Create or update body:

```json
{"name":"sample"}
```

## Docker

```sh
docker build -t compliance-rail-example .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 compliance-rail-example
```

## Backend connection

Open http://localhost:8080 after `go run .` to use the connection page. Enter your private gateway HTTPS address (or localhost during development) and a gateway token. The page sends requests to that gateway, which calls the separately running backend. Additional backend credentials are entered only when required; tokens are not stored. The local `/records` example remains synthetic and separate.

For GitHub Pages, publish the `docs/` folder and set `docs/config.json` gatewayURL to your hosted gateway origin. Leave credentials out of that file. The backend owner must allow the exact UI origin and requested routes. No private source is imported or compiled into this UI. In-memory backend data resets on restart.
